Cake Instructions.

 Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Grease two 8 inch round baking pans with Wilton Cake Release or vegetable pan spray.


In a large mixer bowl, beat butter, sugar and vanilla until creamy. Add eggs and food coloring, then blend well.


Stir together flour, cocoa and salt in a separate bowl. Alternate adding the dry ingredients and the buttermilk (or sour milk) to batter mixture, beating until blended.


Frosting Instructions: While the cake is baking, beat butter and cream cheese in a large bowl with a mixer until light and fluffy.

 
Gradually add in the powdered sugar and milk. Beat on high until smooth for about 30 seconds to a minute.


If the frosting seems too thin, add 1 tablespoon of powdered sugar at a time until the desired thickness is reached. If the frosting seems too thick, add 1 additional teaspoon of milk at a time until frosting reaches the desired consistency.
